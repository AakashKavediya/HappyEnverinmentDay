    <h3>REIMAGINE. RECREATE. RESTORE.</h3>
    <p>We cannot turn back time. But we can grow trees, green our cities, rewild our gardens, change our diets and clean up rivers and coasts. We are the generation that can make peace with nature.

        Let’s get active, not anxious. Let’s be bold, not timid.

        <h3>History of World Environment Day</h3>
        <p>In 1972, the United Nations General Assembly established the World Environment Day on the first day of the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment. Two years later, in 1974 the first WED was held with the theme "Only One Earth". Even though Environment Day celebration have been held annually since 1974, in 1987 the idea for rotating the center of these activities through selecting different host countries began.</p>

        <h3>Timeline of World Environment Day from 2010 to now</h3>
        <p>'Many Species. One Planet. One Future', was the theme of 2010. Hosted in Rwanda, it celebrated the diversity of life on Earth as part of the 2010 International Year of Biodiversity. The world environment day of 2011 was hosted by India and the theme was Forests—Nature At Your Service. World Environment Day 2012's theme was Green Economy. The celebrations were held in Brazil. WED 2013 was themed on the footprint of food, under the slogan “Think, Eat, Save”. The UN reminded us that one third of all food produced fails to make it from farm to table, which means 1.3 billion tonnes of food, worth 1,000 billion dollars, are wasted. This amount would be enough to feed the 870 million people suffering from hunger around the world, as well as reduce CO2 emissions significantly. 2014 was dedicated to the sea, under the theme “Raise your Voice not the Sea Level!” in order to raise awareness on the problems island nations are facing due to rising sea levels. In 2015, WED was hosted by Milan, Italy, under the theme “Seven Billion People. One Planet. Consume with Care”. That year, WED was the most popular subject on Twitter in more than 20 countries. “Zero tolerance for the illegal trade in wildlife” was the theme of the 2016 edition, hosted by Angola, whilst the 2017 edition, was held under the slogan “Connecting People with Nature” to highlight the crucial role we play in protecting the planet, to which we are closely linked and depend on, with official celebrations taking place in Canada. Whilst the 2018 edition, hosted by India, aimed to “Beat Plastic Pollution”. In 2019, WED focussed its efforts to “Beat Air Pollution”, an issue chosen by China, a country deeply affected by this environmental problem.</p>

        <h3>World Environment day for kids</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Make a Green Family Plan.</b>Start your planning, by doing a mini-audit of your family's habits. Try answering questions like: How often do people have baths when showers could do; do you throw clothes in the wash when they could be worn again; do you leave all your appliances plugged in; has your food been imported; do you use reusable shopping bags etc. Once you have an idea of what types of things you can change, make a list of changes your family plans to make and display it in a prominent place – make sure you get the kids involved in making a fun, visual chart that’s engaging for all the family! You can always check out our tips on how to go green for ideas.</li>
            <li><b>Local Litter Picking.</b>Get outside in the fresh air and get down to a hands-on eco-friendly activity that'll really make a difference! Arm you and your kids with collection bags (one for general rubbish and one for recycling items), then head for your local park or green space and start picking up litter. For safety reasons, you might want to borrow or buy some grabbing sticks and make sure everyone's wearing protective gloves. Also, make sure you warn your kids away from picking up broken glass or anything sharp.</li>
            <li><b>Recycling Field Trip.</b> You probably already recycle your rubbish at home, but do your kids actually have any idea where the sorted items actually end up? Although you're unlikely to choose to visit a landfill site, you might be able to get a guided tour of a local recycling facility. Many artists use recycled items – is there studio that does this near you? You could also check out composting at home (see our worm farm article) or at a local allotment.</li>
            <li><b>Appreciate nature.</b>There are so many ways to enjoy the great outdoors. We've got lots of ideas to give you head start. From woodland activities, to nature trails, planting a garden, or making a bird-feeder, just check out our kids’ activities pages for more.</li>
            <li><b>Hold a Toy Exchange.</b>This is a subtle, yet effective way of teaching your kids recycling, the value of pooling resources, and sharing. Encourage your kids to sort through their toys and put aside all those they no longer play with or have out-grown. Invite other families to do the same and then hold a swapping event at your home. Your kids will come away with new toys to play with, and they'll also have recycled the old ones!</li>
